## How to Get Free Dice in Monopoly Go

### 1. Daily Rewards

One of the easiest ways to get free dice in Monopoly Go is through the daily login rewards. The game incentivizes players to log in daily by offering various rewards, including dice. This feature is often part of a streak system, where the longer you log in consecutively, the better the rewards become.

### 2. Completing Missions and Challenges

Monopoly Go frequently hosts in-game events, missions, and challenges that reward players with dice upon completion. These events are time-sensitive and can vary in difficulty, so it's essential to keep an eye on the gameâ€™s notification system to participate in these limited-time events. The rewards often include free dice, boosters, and even rare in-game items.

### 3. Trading with Friends

Monopoly Go allows players to interact with their friends and trade resources, including dice. If you have friends who are actively playing the game, you can exchange in-game resources with them. Itâ€™s a mutually beneficial way to increase your dice supply and strengthen your position in the game.

### 4. Special Offers and Promotions

From time to time, Monopoly Go runs special offers and promotions that allow players to acquire free dice. These offers can come in the form of bundle deals, seasonal events, or temporary boosts. Make sure to check for these offers regularly as they can significantly improve your access to free dice.

### 5. Watching Ads

Monopoly Go offers players the chance to watch advertisements in exchange for rewards, including dice. These ads are optional, but if you want to accumulate dice without spending money, this is a great method to boost your supply. Simply opt to watch a short ad, and youâ€™ll receive free dice in return.

### 6. Referral Programs

Referral programs are a popular way for mobile games to incentivize players to invite others. By sharing your referral code and having new players sign up using it, you can unlock rewards, including free dice. Make sure to use your referral links to invite friends or post them on social media for maximum reach.

### 7. Game Updates and Maintenance

Game updates often come with bonus rewards to thank players for their patience during maintenance. These rewards might include free dice, especially if the update is substantial. Keep an eye out for news regarding updates, and check if any free dice are part of the release notes.

## How to Maximize Your Dice Supply

### 1. Log In Every Day

Consistency is key in Monopoly Go. By logging in every day, even if itâ€™s only for a few minutes, you can claim free dice through daily rewards. Skipping days will cause you to miss out on potential dice, so make sure to maintain a steady login streak.

### 2. Participate in Events and Limited-Time Challenges

In addition to the regular daily missions, Monopoly Go often rolls out seasonal and event-specific challenges. These challenges frequently offer large amounts of free dice. Make sure you stay up to date with any in-game announcements and jump on any special events as soon as they become available.

Many players have found success in sharing tips, tricks, and even codes to unlock free dice through online communities, such as Reddit, Facebook groups, and Discord servers. Joining these communities allows you to stay informed and get access to exclusive giveaways, promotional codes, and tips for obtaining dice.

### 4. Save Your Dice for Strategic Use

While it may be tempting to use dice as soon as you get them, consider saving them for more strategic opportunities. Use dice on high-value properties, or wait for a round when landing on valuable properties will yield more profit. The more strategic you are with your dice, the more you can leverage them to your advantage.

### 5. Avoid Scams

There are many third-party websites and apps that promise free dice in exchange for personal information or completing surveys. These sites often turn out to be scams that can put your account or personal information at risk. Always avoid these scams and stick to legitimate methods within the game.
